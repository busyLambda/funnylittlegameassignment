## Our Goal with the game:
- To make a Getting Over Itesque game with no progress saving and little to no sympathy for the player.

## Documentation:
- We were also tasked with writing a detailed documentation for the game including our expectations, and the process of making the game:
- You can read the wiki [here](https://github.com/busyLambda/funnylittlegameassignment/wiki)

## Assets
- We have used free assets for the game that can be found on itch.io, credit will be displayed here when we gather all of the links.

## License
- We are using the Unlicense License since we know that our code is not the best and no one will try to use it anyway. We also support the open-source cause, so anyone is free to learn, review our code. If any piece of code really makes you angry, feel free to submit a PR or an Issue, we might include the fix in our code if we are not lazy.
